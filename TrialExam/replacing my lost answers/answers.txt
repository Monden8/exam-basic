How can you generate a random number?
 
 With Math.random() -- it generates a number from 0 to 1(not including 1 itself)
 To generate bigger number just multiple it Math.random*x
 To make natural number use Math.floor() 

What is a ternary operator? How does it work?

It's an alternative for IF statements.
It works like (something ? '123' : '456')
-if something is true it gives back"returns" 123
-if something is flas it gives back"returns" 456
// can be chained just like IF
